/**
* A simple file versioning system just represents multiple files
* in a file system, appending the version number to the name.
* For example the following might exist in the file system:
*
*     great-cars-9987.doc
*     great-cars-9987-2.doc
*     great-cars-9987-3.doc
*     great-cars-9987-4.doc
*     great-cars-9987-5.doc
*
* In this case, the container is "great-cars"
* The attachment id is "9987" which is unique within the container.
* The hyphen number at the end is the version number of the attachment.
*
* The drawback of the simple versioning system is obvious: all versions of all
* files are in the directory at the same time, taking up a lot of space.
* Also, the files are all stored local to one system.
* The advantage, however, is that it does not depend upon fancy code
* to unpack or otherwise manipulate things to access the versions.
* Simply find the version by name, and stream it out.  Very fast.
*
* Disks are cheap, and if your documents are mostly binary, then there is
* little need to use a differencing algorithm to store more efficiently.
*
* The original file does not have a version number modifyer.  IF not there,
* the assumption is that it is version 1.
*
* The version number can not exceed 999 or it might be confused with the
* attachment id.
*
* Date and time of the version is taken directly from the file system date.
*
* There is no record of who made the change, and other helpful metadata that
* you would get in a real versioning system.
