/**
* ProfileRequest contains a request from a user to manipulate the profile
* information, but it can not be done in a single step for authentication
* reasons.  Instaed step one is to write down this information, and step
* two is after the email has been confirmed received, to take action.
*
* 1. Reset Password.  The user has forgotten the password, but still remembers
* the email address.  From email address we locate the user, verify that that
* is the primary email address for the user, and send a message to that address
* with the security token in it.  When the user receives the token, that confirms
* that they own the address, and that they are the user in question. So the user
* is logged in and alowed to change the user password.
* Requires: userkey, security token, timestamp
*
* 2. Add Email.  A user is logged in and wants to add a new email message to
* the profile.  We don't do this until we can prove that he owns the address.
* Create a ProfileRequest with a security token, email the security token to
* the new address.  When the user clicks on the link, AND if they are logged in
* as the specified user, then the email is added to the user.
* Requires: userkey, security token, new email, timestamp
*
* 3. Create Profile.  User does not have a profile.  They must provide an
* email address for this.  A Profile Request is created in a global space.
* the security token is emailed to that address.  When the user clicks on the
* link, the empty pofile is created with that email address in it.
* Requires: security token, new email, timestamp
