* The purpose of this class it to remember an assignee to an email message
* and to record WHY that person was assigned to a message, so that a link can
* be generated that allows them to "opt out" of getting the email in the
* future.
*
* There is more than one reason that a user might be assigned to receive
* an email address.  This base class provides the most basic, generic unsubscribe
* link (to the user unsubscribe page).
*
* More specialized classes should:
* 1. provide a way to remove yourself from a role when message was sent to role
* 2. complete or cancel an activity if assigned because of an activity
