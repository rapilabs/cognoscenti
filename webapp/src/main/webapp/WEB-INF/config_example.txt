#Configuration for Cognoscenti Server

# Library Folder
# This is the primary way of saving project information
# in the Cognoscenti server.  Specify a list of lib folders (separated by
# semicolon) and the server will search that folder tree for project files.
# Each project is in its own folder.
# Attachments are stored in the same folder with the project file
# User can edit the attachment files directly, and re-synch later with project.
libFolder=D:/CogData/library/


# User folder
# This is the location where the global user files will be stored.
# Can be any local path, include the complete path to the folder.
# Make sure that this folder exists before you start.
userFolder=D:/CogData/user/


# Data Folder
# This is a folder that holds a couple of global data files.
# Can be any local path, include the complete path to the folder.
# Make sure that this folder exists before you start.
dataFolder=D:/CogData/data/

# Attachment folder
# This is not needed on new installation.  Older servers had a 
# folder for storing the attachments, not needed any more.
# Can be any local path, include the complete path to the folder.
# Make sure that this folder exists before you start.
attachFolder=D:/CogData/attach/


# baseURL
# This is the public base URL address which the browser will
# use to access this server.  Used for redirection of the browser.
# This must use host names that the browser can access.
# eg:   baseURL=http://myserver.example.com/cog/
baseURL=http://myserver.example.com/cog/



#Local Connections designate named paths on the server machine
#to which a local connection can be made
#A sequence of expressions surrounded by square brackets, within
#each expression is a name=path
#use only forward slashes, and end the path with a slash
localConnections=[iflow\=d\:/sandbox/iflow/][photos\=d\:/vacphoto/]

#cvsConnections specifies a list of otential CVS root folders that
#can be used to create a connection to CVS.  A list of triplet values in
#square brackets.  [root=XXX,repository=YYY,sandbox=ZZZ]
